### Linux Shell: Essential Commands Implementation**

This project is a custom Linux shell that supports a set of essential Linux commands, handling file management, system operations, process management, networking, and text processing. The shell is designed to provide users with a streamlined command-line interface, replicating common Linux command behavior with additional functionalities such as viewing and writing files.

The shell offers the following key features:

- **File Management:** Create, navigate, and manipulate files and directories using `ls`, `cd`, `pwd`, `mkdir`, `rm`, `touch`, and `rmdir`.
- **System Operations:** Echo output to the terminal, view file contents, and manage file system usage with commands like `echo`, `vw`, `df`, `du`, and `write`.
- **Process Management:** Manage active processes using commands such as `ps`, `top`, `kill`, `bg`, and `fg`.
- **Networking:** Perform network-related tasks like testing connectivity and viewing network statistics using `ping`, `ifconfig`, `netstat`, and `ssh`.

### Documentation

This custom Linux shell supports a wide range of commands. Below is a detailed explanation of each command with their respective flags and usage examples.

---

## Basic File Operations

### `ls`: List Directory Contents

Lists the contents of a directory.

```bash
ls                            # List contents of the current directory
ls -l                         # List in long format (detailed view)
```

### `cd`: Change Directory

Navigate between directories.

```bash
cd /path/to/directory          # Change to a specified directory
cd                             # Change to the home directory
cd ../                         # Move up one directory level
```

### `pwd`: Print Working Directory

Displays the full path of the current directory.

```bash
pwd                            # Prints the full pathname of the current directory
```

### `mkdir`: Make Directories

Creates a new directory.

```bash
mkdir directory_name           # Create a new directory
```

### `touch`: Create or Update a File

Creates a new file or updates the timestamp of an existing file.

```bash
touch file_name                # Create a new empty file or update timestamp
```

### `rm`: Remove Files or Directories

Deletes files or directories.

```bash
rm file_name                   # Remove a specific file
rm -r directory_name           # Remove a directory and its contents
rm -f file_name                # Force removal of a file
```

### `rmdir`: Remove Empty Directories

Deletes empty directories.

```bash
rmdir directory_name           # Remove an empty directory
```

---

## System Operations

### `echo`: Display Text

Prints text to the terminal.

```bash
echo "Hello, World!"
```

### `vw`: View File Contents or Metadata

Displays the content or information of a file.

```bash
vw file_name -i                # Display file contents
vw file_name -c                # Display file information
```

### `write`: Write to Files

Writes or appends content to a file.

```bash
write -w file_name "content"   # Overwrite file with content
write -a file_name "content"   # Append content to a file
```

### `df`: Disk Space Usage

Displays file system disk space usage.

```bash
df                             # Show disk usage in human-readable format
```

### `du`: Disk Usage of Directories

Estimates file space usage.

```bash
du path                        # Display disk usage of specified directory
```

---

## Process Management

### `ps`: Process Snapshot

Displays information about active processes.

```bash
ps                             # List all running processes
ps -aux                        # Show detailed information about all running processes
```

### `top`: Interactive Process Viewer

Displays active processes interactively with real-time updates.

```bash
top                            # Launch interactive process viewer
```

### `kill`: Terminate Process

Terminates a process using its PID (Process ID).

```bash
kill PID                       # Terminate a process by its PID
kill -9 PID                    # Forcefully terminate a process
```

### `bg`: Resume Background Job

Resumes a suspended job in the background.

```bash
bg job_id                      # Resume a specific job in the background
```

### `fg`: Bring Job to Foreground

Brings a background job to the foreground.

```bash
fg job_id                      # Bring a background job to the foreground
```

---

## Networking

### `ping`: Test Network Connectivity

Sends network requests to test connectivity.

```bash
ping hostname                  # Ping a specific host to test connectivity
```

### `ifconfig`: Configure Network Interfaces

Displays or configures network interfaces.

```bash
ifconfig                       # Display network interface configuration
```

### `netstat`: Network Statistics
